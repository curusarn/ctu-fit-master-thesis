% essential piece on how context is highly dynamic and any context-aware should act conservatively to not dissuade users
% ", a single inappropriate system action may be enough to preclude people from using it further"

% Situated Action vs. plan-based approach
% Determining what information is necessary to infer a contextual state may be difficult
