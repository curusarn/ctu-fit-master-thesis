\begin{introduction}



Classic command line interfaces were mostly replaced by GUIs in consumer software \cite{norman2007ui}. \todo{REF?} However, many professionals around the world still rely on UNIX shells to achieve their daily tasks. CLIs are generally not replaceable by GUIs because GUIs do not scale well when the number of available actions is high \cite{norman2007ui}. 

More than half of all developers use Unix-based operating systems\footnote{According to \cite{stackoverflow2019devsurvey}, 25.6\% and 26.8\% of developers uses Linux and MacOS respectively.}. 
About half of all developers have been working with Linux during year 2018. \cite{stackoverflow2019devsurvey} 

Default shell on GNU/Linux is bash \cite{ramey1994gnubash} and default shell on MacOS is zsh since October 2019 \cite{apple2019zsh}. In this work we primarily focus on these two popular shells.
\todo{TODO: polish the argument why is this work relevant \hatx\hatx\hatx}

The standard shell history contains records with basic information about previously executed command lines. Each record only contains following details: the command line, timedate of the execution, and the duration of the execution\footnote{Duration is only available in zsh and only when it is enabled.\cite{zshdocs}}. 

Additionally, it is quite common to use shell configuration\footnote{\todotext{e.g. bash: histocontrol=ignoredups\cite{bashman}; zsh: HIST\_SAVE\_NO\_DUPS\cite{zshdocs}}} to prune duplicates from the history. This removes more information from history because the original command line sequences are lost.

As we can see the standard shell history contains only very basic information about executed command lines.
There is much more contextual data available at the time of command line execution e.g. present working directory, exit status, and previously executed commands. In this work, we explore the possibilities of using the contextual data about executed commands to increase the usefulness of shell history.



% BAD: This limits the potential of standard shell history utilities because shell usage is contextual. is not generally used to run ad-hoc commands but 

% MORE PRACTICAL: When using shells you likely do not run individual commands completely independently of each other. But instead run commands as parts of different workflows that 

\todotext{TODO: describe the contents of this work / layout} We start by analysing shell history features to understand advantages and disadvantages of standard shell history. We research existing history tools to see what ideas were already explored, which features work and which do not. 

After that, we focus on people. We start broad and research how people use computer tools in general. Then we move on to examining how people use shell and shell history.

Next, we focus on the contextual information; We cover what information is available to be saved at the time of command line execution and we discuss how it could be used to enhance shell history.

At this point we move on to design(ing) ...

\section{Use cases}



\begin{conclusion}

\todotext{TODO: rewrite conclusion}

I have analysed shell history features available in current shells. I explored available history tools and found both positive and negative inspiration.

\par I have found previous research on how people use shell and shell history.  
I have collected a sample of shell history. I have analyzed the collected usage data and compared it to data used in existing research. I have found which characteristics of shell usage changed over time and which characteristics stayed the same. I have concluded that most of the principals and ideas from the existing research do still hold. I have found out that potential recalled characters increased 4 times since the study was conducted. This and other differences reinforced the idea that it makes sense to design and develop new history related tools. 

\par I have conducted a market research to find out how people interact with shell history and what are the workflows that are not well supported nowadays. I have modelled personas representing target users of the system. I have put together use cases based on actual shell history I have collected.
I have designed a contextual shell history tools based on problems and suggestions from existing literature, user-centered design guidelines and principals, information learned via market research, and modelled personas.
I have actively sought feedback from users during both design and implementation. 

I have used usability principals and heuristics to test and evaluate the design.

\par I have implemented a significant portion of the design. The project unobtrusively records shell history with context. It does both use context to offer relevant history records and for searching via fullscreen command line application.
I have made sure that it's easy to install, update, configure and use. I have shared the resulting implementation with community and received overwhelmingly positive feedback and interest of contributors. Project was downloaded and installed over 5 hundred times since January. Github page of the project consistently attracts daily visitors.  

\par I have described a number of possible metrics. I have explained why simple metrics are not sufficient. I have described the drawbacks of metrics in general. I have suggested meaningful metrics that can be used to evaluate shell history tools. I have used the suggested metrics to evaluate my implementation where possible. 

\par I have used modelled personas and use cases to evaluate utility and usability of the system.
I have used real life user data to evaluate user experience of the solution.


I have made it easier to collect and study usage of shell and shell history in future research.
I have proved that having contextual shell history brings many benefits. 
I have demonstrated public demand for history tools. 
I have created a universal shell library for binding custom functions to keys with the option to revert to previous state.
