\begin{introduction}

Classic command line interfaces were mostly replaced by GUIs in consumer software \cite{norman2007ui}. However, among IT professionals and enthusiasts, CLIs and shells are a popular way to interact with computers.\footnote{CLIs and shells are active topics on websites that are popular among developers. Specifically, GitHub Topics, Stack Overflow, and Super User all register notable activity under topics/tags about CLIs, Bash, and Zsh.} 
%CLIs are generally not replaceable by GUIs. GUIs do not work well when the number of available actions is high \cite{norman2007ui}. 

Shell history enables shell users to reuse previously entered command line submissions.
There are many people who care about shell history tools.\footnote{We have sparked a wave of reactions by asking people about what shell history tools they are using.\cite{twitter-thread}}

Shells like Bash and Zsh were initially released around the year 1990. History features in these shells have not seen many improvements since the beginning of the millennium. In this work, we analyze the standard shell history mechanisms to find how they could be improved.

People use shell differently in different situations. For example, some directories contain projects, and people might use different commands based on which project they are working on. We think that we could use directories and more additional information to improve the capabilities of shell history. 

We focus on Unix-based operating systems because more than half of all developers use them\footnote{According to \cite{stackoverflow2019devsurvey}, 25.6\% and 26.8\% of developers use Linux and MacOS, respectively.}. 
Default shell on GNU/Linux is Bash \cite{ramey1994gnubash} and default shell on MacOS is Zsh\footnote{According to \cite{apple2019zsh}, Zsh is the default shell in MacOS since October 2019.}. Because of that, we focus on these two popular shells.


In the first chapter, we examine standard history features and what issues people encounter when using them. We introduce target users and formulate typical shell history workflows. Then, we explore existing history tools and how they improve standard shell history. In the second chapter, we design a new contextual history system based on our analysis. Third, we describe the implementation of the core parts of the designed system. Finally, in the fourth chapter, we test the system using data we collect from our users. Based on that, we draw conclusions about this work.

\section*{Defined terms}

To avoid confusion throughout this work, we define several terms.

\paragraph{Command line entry} The contents of the command line submitted by the user to the shell. We sometimes also use terms \textit{history entry} or \textit{command line submission}. 

\paragraph{Command stub} The first word of the command line entry, usually an executable program or a script.

\begin{conclusion}

Shell history makes people more productive by allowing them to reuse previously executed command line entries. People use shell for different tasks they want to achieve. Specific tasks often involve particular commands, directories, and other context. The topic of this work is to use available contextual information such as directories to improve the capabilities of shell history features.

We have examined shell history features available in Bash and Zsh. % and pointed out their disadvantages. 
%We have described the target users of our shell history tool. 
We have introduced typical shell history workflows based on interviews with users and shell usage data we collected. Then, we have described these workflows in detail to explain limitations and disadvantages of standard shell history features.
As the main finding, we have identified reverse search as a very inefficient history feature that is worth redesigning.

We have explored popular history tools. Among these tools, we have found state-of-the-art non-contextual history tools that provide a major improvement over standard history by replacing reverse search. These tools address the specific issues of reverse search we identified. We found contextual history tools that are based on appealing ideas; These tools, however, do not match the improvements provided by state-of-the-art non-contextual history tools. %We have described how available contextual information relates to the ways people use shell. 


% design

Based on our previous analysis, we have designed a history system. The design is a result of the iterative process that involved feedback from users. Our design matches the improvements of the state-of-the-art non-contextual history tools. Furthermore, it uses context to enhance the capabilities of the shell history. %The design was tested to make sure that it fulfills all set requirements. 

% implementation

We have implemented a significant portion of the design. The working solution records shell history with context and usage. It features a full-screen terminal application that searches shell history and shows relevant results based on the current context. Without any search query, the application offers history entries from the current context. 

% evaluation/testing

We have evaluated the performance of the search application and compared it with both state-of-the-art and standard ways to search history. 
We have suggested metrics and used them to compare our solution with state-of-the-art history searching tool -- Hstr.% \cite{toolshstr}.
The average performance of our history searching application is either similar or better than Hstr. 

We have found real-life situations where our solution provides a significant advantage over both standard reverse search and Hstr.
Our solution enables the user to search with significantly less knowledge and typing. Furthermore, our search application, on average, saves more typed characters to the user. 
We have concluded that contextual search is a great default because it offers new possibilities without degrading the average performance.


As a result of feedback from our users, we have added several features to the search application. Notably, users can switch between default contextual search and non-contextual search. This is great for specific situations where using context does not bring value.

Since the release of the first prototype, four months ago, the search application has been installed over 600 times. The project has over 250 stars on GitHub. The feedback we have received is overwhelmingly positive. %We have also got a chance to present one of the first versions of the application on Installfest conference. \cite{installfest-talk}\cite{installfest} 

Right now, we want to encourage you, the reader, to try out the project for yourself. You can find installation instructions on the GitHub page of the project: \url{https://github.com/curusarn/resh} %\cite{resh-github-homepage}


\section*{Future work}

Our work implements the core functionality of the designed history system. However, the remaining parts of the design should also be implemented because they provide considerable value to the users.

One part of the design we want to point out is synchronization.
Implementing the synchronization connectors for the daemon would enable history searching across devices. It would also make the stored history replicated, which could prevent potential data loss.

Outside of the things we have included in the design, we suggest an improvement for our search application based on existing research. According to \cite{greenberg1993computer}, history entries that were already retrieved should be easier to retrieve in the future. The scoring function should be modified to include this extra factor. 

Additionally, we propose a topic for future research. Using machine learning techniques and context to provide Autosuggestions tailored to the user is a promising topic for a thesis. 

More research should be done to explore relationships between history entries. Exploring how terminal sessions and sequences of history entries relate to workflows of people could bring useful insights. These insights could be used to improve history searching tools.

\section{Sequential structure of command usage}\label{seq-app}

Figure \ref{seq-graph} shows sequential relationships between command stubs in shell usage of a single chosen user. 

The graph contains 41 most used commands. Each node represents a command stub, and its size is proportionate to the command stub frequency. Each vertex represents a transition probability from one command to the next one. Nodes \verb|_start_| and \verb|_end_| represent the beginning and end of terminal sessions.

We can see that there are significant dependencies between command stubs. Many commands repeat themselves with high probabilities. There are also high probability transitions between specific commands. For example, \verb|mkdir| is followed by \verb|cd| in 90\% of situations.

%This is all interesting, but is it usable in practice? Do people even recognize these sequential relationships in their shell usage?
We created sequential graphs like this based on the shell history of different users. When we show these graphs to the original user, they always instantly recognize their history. Furthermore, they can immediately spot and describe the workflows represented by different sequences in the graph.
